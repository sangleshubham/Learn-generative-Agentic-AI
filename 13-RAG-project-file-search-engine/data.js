    `Experience - Lodha Group November 2023 – Present
Software Development Engineer II — Backend, Node.js Mumbai, IN
• Collaborated with MongoDB experts and led the team in fine-tuning schemas, integrating Atlas Search, creating
efficient indexes, and crafting performant aggregation pipelines. Then, heavy queries were moved to batch jobs, resulting
in a 150% jump in read/write throughput.
• Implemented Monstache CDC (Change Data Capture) pipeline between MongoDB and Elasticsearch enabling instant
search functionality, collectively resulted in a 50% cost reduction by scaling down from M40 to M30 Atlas Cluster
while maintaining system scalability.
• Architected and implemented a user-level caching library, reducing API response times from 800ms to 20ms (40X
improvement) and dramatically enhancing the loading speed of the app during startup.
• Led a team of 4 Developers and drove cross-functional design sessions for microservices and APIs, clarifying
requirements, cutting inter-team dependencies and accelerating feature delivery by 20%.
• Integrated BullMQ to manage notification workflows—including queuing, scheduling, retry logic, DLQs,
and priority-based execution—sustaining 100k requests per minute on a single r8g.large EC2 instance.
• Led the development and seamless integration of a commercial Visitor Management System (VMS), eliminating manual
check-ins and generating an additional Rs.60 Lakh in annual revenue.
• Developed a robust file upload system with S3 pre-signed URLs, virus scanning for S3 (ClamAV), content-type
verification, SHA-256 integrity validation, and a comprehensive log (customer/ IP details) for compliance.
• Architected a multi-channel notification system using AWS Pinpoint that delivers targeted communications across
web, Android, and iOS platforms with detailed analytics tracking (received, clicked, converted), resulting in 40%
higher marketplace interaction rates and 70% improvement in overall user engagement metrics.`,
    `Experience - GamerJi May 2023 – October 2023
Software Development Engineer II — Backend, Node.js Pune, IN
• Led a project overhaul that streamlined the project structure, resulting in cleaner code for schema and API,
improved code reusability by up to 30%.
• Orchestrated zero-downtime upgrades to the latest versions of Node.js, MongoDB (and its drivers), and all
supporting architecture components.`,
    `Experience - Infosys August 2021 – May 2023
Digital Specialist Engineer — MEAN Stack Pune, IN
• Built Node.js API and Angular frontend for user profiles, storing data for millions of CITI bank users.
• Dockerised several Node.js microservices for Citi’s private OpenShift cloud to make it easier for developers to deploy.
• Wrote test cases for microservices using JEST and the frontend using Karma-Jasmine with test coverage of 85%.
• Configured Winston logger for asynchronous logging in the database, resulting in a centralized log and reducing
loophole exploitation by 90%.`,
    `Experience - SkillEdge November 2020 – July 2021
Developer & Security Engineer Intern Pune, IN
• Developed Node.js APIs that power scalable LMS user & coursework workflows and built custom WordPress
hooks/plugins for seamless, secure student authentication on web & Android apps—no data migration needed.

SSH File Explorer | Node.js, node-ssh, sFTP, commander, inquirer, chalk March 2025
• Lightweight CLI for password or SSH-key auth, enabling fast remote file exploration and sFTP downloads.
Circuit Breaker for Micro-services | Node.js, Redis February 2025
• Demo of a Redis-backed circuit-breaker pattern: services publish real-time health and callers auto-halt on “down”.`,

    `Publications & Technical Writing
• Research Paper — This paper leverages advanced image-processing to detect vehicle-related criminal activity.
• SQL Injection Security Article — In article, I’ve shared my experience of hacking university and my college site.`,
